	<p class="header">GRADING FAQs</p>

	<div class="question">How do I lay out my post?</div>
	<div class="answer">At the top of each event you will find a pinned example post. Copy the post and add your own team/tier information. Once your main post is customized with your info, copy each comment from the example post and comment them under your post in order.</div>

	<div class="question">How do I find my post?</div>
    <div class="answer">Once you make a post, hit the three dots in the right corner of it and click “save”. You'll be able to find it in your saved posts after that!</div>

	<div class="question">What are the tiers?</div>
    <div class="answer">For weekly events, we have three tiers: Under the Sea, Heigh Ho, and Maximus.<br/>
    Under the Sea is 100 stitches per challenge, earning 2 points each.<br/>
    Heigh Ho is 200 stitches per challenge, earning 4 points each.<br/>
    Maximus is 300 stitches per challenge, earning 6 points each.</div>

	<div class="question">Do I have to stick with one tier?</div>
    <div class="answer">No! You can do different tiers in the same week. For example, you might choose to do #1-3 in Maximus tier and the rest in Heigh Ho. If you choose to do different tiers, put “custom” in the tier spot of your main post.</div>

	<div class="question">What if I don't have a WIP that fits the challenge?</div>
    <div class="answer">Not to worry! We allow the Disney+ option on all challenges. On weekly events, we also allow penalty stitching on any WIP you choose - just double the stitch count if your WIP doesn't fit the challenge or Disney+ option. For example, for Maximus tier, you would stitch 600 stitches if using the penalty option.</div>

	<div class="question">What is the Disney+ option?</div>
    <div class="answer">For weekly and monthly challenges, if you don't have a WIP that fits the prompt, you may substitute in any Disney/Marvel/Star Wars WIP or any BAP and stitch the same amount of stitches. For example, if a prompt calls for 400 stitches on something with an apple, you can stitch 400 stitches on a Disney/Marvel/Star Wars WIP or on a BAP.</div>

	<div class="question">What qualifies as a BAP?</div>
    <div class="answer">A BAP (Big Ass Project) is any full-coverage project that is at least 4 pages or 20k stitches. There must be no unstitched space for it to qualify, and blackwork does not count - it must be FULL coverage.</div>

	<div class="question">If I use the Disney+ option, do I need to stitch extra stitches?</div>
    <div class="answer">No! If you are using the Disney+ option, you only need the amount of stitches called for in the prompt.</div>

	<div class="question">What do I need to include in my posts?</div>
    <div class="answer">For monthly, we just need your reasoning (why your WIP fits the prompt), your before and after pics, and your stitch count. For weekly, we need all of that PLUS the password in every start pic. <br/><br/>
	⚠️Please make sure to include accurate stitch count (or time if using time) with your finish picture (for example, finish - 312 stitches) - our graders do not love to be slowed down to do your math! If you use multiple WIPs (where allowed), make sure to total your stitches at the end. It saves us a lot of time!<br/><br/>
	⚠️Posts must be laid out like the example post, or we may not be able to award points. This may seem overly strict, but with 1500 people in the group, we have to streamline things as much as possible to allow our graders as much time to stitch as possible, since they are all volunteering their time!</div>

	<div class="question">How does the password work?</div>
    <div class="answer">The password will be posted at the beginning of the weekly event. It must be PHYSICALLY in each weekly start pic. If the password is absent or digitally added to your pic, you will not receive points for that challenge.</div>

	<div class="question">What do the grading reactions mean?</div>
    <div class="answer">When you have been graded, you will receive either a “like” or a “heart” reaction. “Heart” means everything is correct (hooray!!). “Like” means something needs to be fixed -  check your post for feedback from the grader. If you don't stitch on an event, your post will also receive a “like”.</div>

	<div class="question">How does double dipping work?</div>
    <div class="answer">Monthly events may double dip with yearly “Reflections of Evil” - just add your start and end pics with stitch count on your yearly post.<br/>
    Movie challenges can double dip with everything! This includes the SAL challenge that is part of the movie event.The SAL challenge must be something that is or was released on parts as a SAL, and does not include our Zero to Hero event.<br/>
    Weekly events can only double dip with movie and Zero to Hero events.</div>

	<div class="question">⚠️Who are the graders?</div>

	<div class="question">⚠️ Who do I contact if I have a problem?</div>
    <div class="answer">First, try your team chat! Unsolicited private messages to leaders or graders will not be tolerated.</div>

	<div class="question">⚠️Who should I ask if I have more questions?</div>
    <div class="answer">First, make sure to read the event directions and check the example post! That should answer most questions. If you have more questions after that, try your team chat! Reserve the general questions chat for bigger questions (for example, a fantastic general chat question would be This movie isn't available in my country, does anyone have any recommendations?)<br/><br/>
	⚠️NOTE: Please keep in mind that all the leaders are real people with real lives, volunteering our time. We are an international team, so keep in mind that it's highly likely the person you are asking is in a completely different time zone - be patient! <br/><br/>
	⚠️Before asking questions, remember that almost every challenge is open to interpretation. Refer to this post and to your own interpretation before asking questions of your leaders, and remember that we will not always be able to answer questions instantly!</div>
